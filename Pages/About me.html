                   I have been listening to Metal since I was 10 years old. I really got interested in Metal music through Iron Maiden. Since then, I have been listening more and more Death Metal. The band that got me into Death Metal was Death. I also like Messugah. Through Messugah I got into Rush. Rush got me into Progressive Rock. I also listen to Flamenco music. I got into it through listening to Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin. Right now I am listening to John McLaughlin's Shakti and Opeth's Blackwater Park.

                    I really enjoy playing soccer in my spare time. I can play as a wingback or a defensive midfielder. However, I have also played as a centre-back. My role models as a kid was Lampard however, I am more of a Steven Gerrard/Andrea Pirlo-esque. In Football Manager lingo, I play as a Regista when playing as a defensive midfielder. I intercept passes, protect the backline and distribute the ball to fullback/wingbacks. (at least I try to haha) In Europe, I support Chelsea Football Club.

                   I work out regularly. I love cooking and eating. I really like Japanese, Itallian and Indian cuisine. I love to paint. I have not been able to paint much due to the regular switch from univeristy and coop. I am really interested in landscape art of the Group of Seven, Kim Dorland and Van Gogh.
