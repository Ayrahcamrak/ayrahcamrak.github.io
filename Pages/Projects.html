I have also bought almost all of the parts required for it. The second phase of the project is to start the fabrication of the part. The plan is to use high quality styrofoam or similar material to make the fusulage. I am also learning how to solder parts for this project. The part should be done by the end of the term.

                       <div class="description"> Before the printing process actually began, I gave lectures to students and TAs about the 3D printing process and efficient ways of printing. Their prints were limited to 2.5 cubic inches of model and support material. After the lectures, I Worked with different members of the University to get GrabCAD Print in some computer labs to help students design better. When the CAD files was sent to me by the students, I was responsible for evaluating each cell-phone stand design and making sure the part did not exceed the 2.5 cubic inches limit. If they did I would advise them ways to solve it. In total, I printed ~380 cell-phone stands in about a week while maintaining regular printing service for other customers.

We also 3D printed the lego pieces in both facilities as a physical comparision between two.

The project resulted in a safer work space.

Before this, customers would directly send requests through the email. A lot of the customers failed to produce some crucial information frequently. Going back to them and asking for it meant initial order to production time was quite big, around 2-3 days. However, with the online order form actively asking for all the required information, the order to production time decreased to 1-2 days. I made many changes after the initial release of the form and maintained it throughout.

Then me and my team made a electric sensor. Later, I created a mechanical sensor to measure the level of water in any enclosed container to be used as a substitute for the electrical sensor. I used CATIA to create a 3D CAD model. I also created a prototype to understand the shortcomings of design. The most important thing that I learned was that part cannot let any water for long term functional capacity. </div>
