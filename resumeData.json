    "bio1":"I am a mechanical engineer focusing on mechanical design, rapid prototyping, Finite Element Analysis, Numerical analysis and automation. I am passionate about designing and building interdisciplinary engineering solutions in a hands-on environment. I live by the ideas of self-improvement in every facet of my life. My determination for excellence is complemented by a sense of humility to stay focused on my goals and learning.",
    "bio2":"In my free time, I paint, read books, listen to music, play chess, cook and watch soccer. I usually read non fiction books with Homo Deus being my favourite. I usually listen to progressive rock and metal with Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Iron Maiden being my favourite. I love making tiramisu. I usually paint landscape or abstract inspired by Ahmed Alsoudani and Francis Bacon. My favourite player currently playing is Eden Hazard (when he's playing).",
