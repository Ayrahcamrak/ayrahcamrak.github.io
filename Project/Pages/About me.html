                   I used to listen to variety of music when I was young. However, I really got into listening to music when I discovered Iron Maiden and, subsequently Metal. Since then, I have been listening to more and more Metal music. Currently, my favourite Metal bands are Iron Maiden, Death, (and inceasingly) Meshuggah. Through Messugah I got into Rush. I really enjoy Rush. Rush got me into Progressive Rock. I also listen to Flamenco music. I got into it through listening to Paco De Lucia and John McLaughlin. Right now I am listening to John McLaughlin's Shakti and Opeth's Blackwater Park.

                    I really enjoy playing soccer in my spare time. I can play as a wingback or a defensive midfielder. However, I have also played as a centre-back. My role models as a kid was Lampard however, I am more of a Steven Gerrard/Andrea Pirlo-esque. In Football Manager lingo, I play as a Regista when playing as a defensive midfielder. I intercept passes, protect the backline and distribute the ball to fullback/wingbacks. (at least I try to haha) In Europe, I support Chelsea Football Club.

                   I work out regularly. I love cooking and eating. I really like Japanese, Itallian and Indian cuisine. I love to paint. I have not been able to paint much due to the regular switch from univeristy and coop. I am really interested in landscape art of the Group of Seven, Kim Dorland and Van Gogh.
