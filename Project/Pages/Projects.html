                       <div class="description"> I had to design and creat an online form in the University of Waterloo's 3D Print Centre's website to decrease the order-to-production time. Before this, customers would directly send requests through the email. A lot of the customers failed to produce some crucial information frequently. Going back to them and asking for it meant initial order to production time was quite big, around 2-3 days. However, with the online order form actively asking for all the required information, the order to production time decreased to 1-2 days. I made many changes after the initial release of the form and maintained it throughout.

                       <div class="description"> This project was ispired by 1B mech-days where we had to create a sensor to measure level of water in a bucket. Then me and my team made a electric sensor. Later, I created a mechanical sensor to measure the level of water in any enclosed container to be used as a substitute for the electrical sensor. I used CATIA to create a 3D CAD model. I also created a prototype to understand the shortcomings of design. The most important thing that I learned was that part cannot let any water for long term functional capacity. </div>

                       I was responsible for planning of the project. I also had to organise the other students. I also had to manage the resources that were allocated for this project by the school librarian, me and other students. The project was 8 months long. During that time, I worked 2.5+ hours every day excluding weekends and holidays.
