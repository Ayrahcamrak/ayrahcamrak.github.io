                            <li class = "p_entry">I was assigned a heat transfer project to study how fins can help cool down a part. The part here has the left side heated to a constant temperature. While the other surface is subject to convection. Also, the fin does not cover the entirity of the part when in use. So, the corners have to be taken into consideration as well. The environment was considered to be at 20 deg C. Radiation was not taken into consideration.</li>
                            
                            <li class = "p_entry">Firstly, I divided the part and the possible fin into different regions. Then, I derived the equations for each region. I decided to use symmetry of the geometry to my advantage and only calculated the values once. The number of nodes was left as an arbitrary value dependent on the spatial step size. </li>

                            <li class = "p_entry">Four studies were done; study without a fin, with a fin and steady state with a corrective addiabatic tip, with a fin and steady state without a corrective addiabatic tip and, with a fin and unsteady state without a corrective addiabatic tip. The last one with the unsteady state is the most accurate but the difference between it and the steady state with corrective tip isnt high. Also, I decided that the fin wasn't that good because the surface of the part didnt decrease that much in temperature. </li>

We first decided on 3D printing some parts and then using acetone bath. Especially the gears. But later we decided to go with laser cutter because it is easier and faster to fabricate using that method. Also, we thought the laser cutter would produce even better parts than 3D printing with respect to the gears.</li>

                            <li class = "p_entry">Background: 600 series, a laser de-coating solution by Besnovo Inc., has a set of large components that are mounted on an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV). In order to power these components while maintaining a safe and organized work space, a need existed for a system to organize and supply 6 cable reels with power, acting as an intermediary unit between the AGV components and an external power source </li>
                            
                            <li class = "p_entry">Problem: A solution already existed in the form of V1 Cable Reel Platform (CRP) as seen in Figure 1. However, this mobile platform can only house 3 cable reels which can accommodate a cable each. Therefore, the objective was to design a new version of the CRP system, V2 CRP, with the reel capacity of 6 reels while maintaining the cost of the previous design, V1 CRP system.</li>
                            
                            <li class = "p_entry">My role: I was responsible for the redesigning, FEA on the redesign and reporting the results to my suervisor.</li>
                            
                            <li class = "p_entry">In order to do so, first conceptual designs for housing 6 cable reels were cre-ated. Then, in order to incorporate that functionality into the main design, various smaller design changes had to be made. After which, the design had to go through various tests in order to verify structural safety and adherence to its functional requirements.</li>
                            
                            <li class = "p_entry">The V2 CRP system, as seen in Figure2, manages to combine twocable reels into one swivel base. The first cable reel is in the default configuration. While, the second cable reel is rotated 180 degrees around the vertical axis, and the cable reel outlet adapter rotated 180 degrees. This design minimized the amount of space used per each reel. However, that also infers that there is more load concentrated on the frame at the specific point where the two reels areplaced. Also, this method requires an intermediary plate betweenthe swivel-base and the two cable reels to secure the cable reels tothe swivel base. Therefore, two FEA tests had to be done, one onthe base frame and the other on the interface plate.</li>
                            
                            <li class = "p_entry">The FEA studies demonstrated that the V2 CRP can withstand theload of 6 cable reels with minimal deflection. The tipping calculations also demonstrated that the V2 CRP design can withstand thetension forcesfrom the cableswithout the systemtipping over. The final design is of the V2 CRP exceeded expectations set earlier in thedesign lifecycle.</li>
                            
                            <li class = "p_entry">The design decreased the material cost by 25% cheaper, 49% smaller and 38% lighter while having doubled the cable capacity 25% and meeting all the other non-functional requirements. The design also met the functional requirements by increasing the ca-ble reel capacity to 6 cable reels while allowing those cable reels at least 90 degrees of free motion.</li>

Going back to them and asking for it meant initial order to production time was quite big, around 2-3 days. However, with the online order form actively asking for all the required information, the order to production time decreased to 1-2 days. I made many changes after the initial release of the form and maintained it throughout.
